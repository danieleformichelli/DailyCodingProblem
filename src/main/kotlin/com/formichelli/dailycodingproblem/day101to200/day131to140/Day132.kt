/*
Design and implement a HitCounter class that keeps track of requests (or hits). It should support the following operations:

record(timestamp): records a hit that happened at timestamp
total(): returns the total number of hits recorded
range(lower, upper): returns the number of hits that occurred between timestamps lower and upper (inclusive)
Follow-up: What if our system has limited memory?
