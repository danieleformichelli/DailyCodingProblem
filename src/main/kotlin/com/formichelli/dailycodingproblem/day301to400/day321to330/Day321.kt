/*
Given a positive integer N, find the smallest number of steps it will take to reach 1.

There are two kinds of permitted steps:

You may decrement N to N - 1.
If a * b = N, you may decrement N to the larger of a and b.
For example, given 100, you can reach 1 in five steps with the following route: 100 -> 10 -> 9 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1.
